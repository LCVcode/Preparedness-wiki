## Overview
The purpose of a *wilderness survival kit* is to prevent all of the most common forms of life-threatening situations encountered in the wilderness.  This kit is **absolutely mandatory** when going into the wilderness.  
## Essential components
### [[First Aid Kit]]
**Never go into the wilderness without essential first-aid supplies.  Doing so is irresponsible and stupid.**  
### [[Navigation Kit]]
A navigation kit assists with avoiding dangerous terrain and exfiltrating the wilderness when desired.  
### [[Fire Kit]]
Going with a simple *small fire kit* is just fine in most cases.  Adapt as needed.
