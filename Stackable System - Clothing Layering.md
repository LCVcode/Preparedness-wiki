## Overview
The *Stackable System* is a cold weather clothing layering system that prioritizes adding or removing layers from the top of the stack, if you will.  This minimizes or can even completely eliminate the need to remove one or more outer layers to apply or remove some inner layer(s).  This means that lower layers are necessarily worn more often than outer layers, with the first several layers often being worn continuously.

## Layers
### 1. Base Layer
#### Overview
The base layer is the closest layer to the skin, or the "next-to-skin" layer.  It obviously insulates you, but its biggest role is moisture management.  When you sweat or get wet, the base layer will wick that moisture away from your skin so it can absorb into the next layer and have a chance to evaporate.  It is critical to not prohibit this process, typically by putting on a vapor barrier, such as a rain jacket or large puffy jacket.  
#### Fabric Choices
##### Cotton
**Cotton kills.**  Never consider 100% cotton as your base layer.
##### Synthetics
Synthetics are a good choice for a base layer, especially for shorter outings where they are not likely to get especially stinky.  Many synthetic shirts will include a hoodie, which can be helpful in all kinds of conditions.  While not necessary, many people like having some kind of collar or hood on their base layer, so that it is available whenever they strip down to that layer.  
##### Wool
Modern Morena wool is a great choice for a base layer.  
##### Blended Materials
Blended materials are the preferred base layer fabric for most people.  They combine the properties of two different fabrics, creating a more desirable mixture.  Notably, ~90% wool and ~10% synthetic is specially desirable.  
#### Fabric Thickness
##### Lightweight
Great choice for summer or the "shoulder season", characterized by warm days and cooler nights.
##### Midweight
Generally the best choice, outside of especially warm weather.  Balances heating and cooling, making it the most suitable for the widest range of conditions.  
##### Heavyweight
Almost never the right choice for a base layer, as heavyweight can prevent proper cooling when shed all the way down to base layer.  One especially good use for heavyweight base layers is when sleeping, as it will obviously keep you warmer than a lightweight or midweight.
#### Look for These:
- Zippers
- Pockets
- Hoodie or collar
- Zippers in base layer bottoms
### 2. Wind Layer
#### Overview
Arguably the most important and most misunderstood layer that requires a significant amount of consideration, the wind layer prevents heat loss by putting some kind of barrier between you and the cold wind.  Many people choose a simple ran jacket for this purpose, which is often misguided, as these kinds of garments are vapor barriers, locking moisture in while keeping it out.  Ironically, this often results in being overheated and wet, despite wearing a waterproof layer.

The wind layer should be wind-resistant, but not 100% windproof; you do want a little bit of airflow between layers.  The primary objective with this layer is maintaining comfort by taking the bite out of the wind, rather than stopping it completely.  

The wind layer should be sized large enough to fit over the largest puffy jacket that you are going to bring while also not being too baggy to be worn over just the base layer.  Most of the time, you will be wearing the wind layer directly over the base layer. 

#### Look for These:
- A removable hood or a zipper on the collar or a zipper around the hood
	- Allows for attaching a fur ruff
- Stow able hood
