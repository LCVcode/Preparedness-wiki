## What is first aid?
First aid is often misunderstood by the layman as applying Neosporin and a band-aids to various minor cuts, bumps, and bruises.  **The purpose of first aid is to temporarily treat any life-threatening or otherwise serious injury long enough to get to proper medical care.**  Accordingly, ailments do not have to be completely treated by first aid.  Rather, they must facilitate the injured party in leaving the current situation and getting to proper medical care.  

Depending on the situation, the duration of time that first aid is required can vary wildly.  Someone suffering from a serious knife wound in the kitchen only needs first aid for the duration of the drive to the emergency room, often less than half an hour.  In contrast, a hunter deep in the woods who suffers a similar injury may be a day or two walk from their vehicle, then a possible long drive from a hospital, so first aid will be required for a much longer period of time.  Likewise, an injured party in a bug-out situation may require first aid for weeks or months before it is safe to seek medical care.
