## Overview
The primary purpose of first aid kits, or medical kits, is to provide the resources and tools need to supply proper [[First Aid]] to yourself or another.  These kits will look different depending upon the unique context in which they are designed and can vary considerably in size and functionality.  To build your own kit, always start by first identifying the needs you are trying to provide for.

**A word of caution:** the most commonly available first aid kits found online boast about being a 100-piece or 200-piece or similar kit, which is ultimately meaningless.  In these kits are all some flavor of a pile of band-aids plus some alcohol wipes.  These kits do not meet the standard of treating life-threatening or other serious injuries, as anything that can be fixed by a band-aid was not serious to begin with.  In my experience, the vast majority of the items in these kits will expire long before they are used.  Do not buy or build kits like this, except maybe for a child's first aid kit, which will always have to be supplemented by a proper kit.  

## Wilderness IFAK (Individual First Aid Kit)
### Overview
This kit addresses first aid needs in a wilderness survival context, such as camping, hunting, or general bushcraft and woodscraft.  The injured party may be a one or more day's walk through rough terrain away from rescue.  In the case of an immobilizing injury which prevents an injured party from walking out of the wilderness, this kit will facilitate staying in-place and waiting for rescue.  When headed into the wilderness, always tell others where you plan to be and when you expect to return.

The injuries addressed in this kit include the Five Bs of [[First Aid]] and gun shot wounds (from a hunter).  It also includes items to facilitate effective rescue.
