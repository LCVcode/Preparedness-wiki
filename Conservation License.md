## Overview

**Everyone ages 12 and older will need a Montana Conservation License to access most state lands.** This includes all types of recreation—launching watercraft, hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, etc.

For trappers, commercial, or concentrated recreational users, a Special Recreational Use License is still required for use on these properties. Information on access is available [here.](https://dnrc.mt.gov/TrustLand/public-use/)
**A Conservation License is required to access most state lands** including fishing access sites (FAS), wildlife management areas (WMA), and wildlife habitat protection areas (WHPA). Montana State Parks do not require a Conservation License.   

People recreating on Montana state trust lands have previously been required to purchase an additional State Lands Recreational Use License to access these properties.  With the new law, the purchase of a  Conservation License is all that is required to access state lands.

### What you need to apply for a Conservation License
