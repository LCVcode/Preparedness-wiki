## Regulations & Seasons

**A valid fishing license enables you to fish from March 1 through the end of February of the following year.**
#### Before fishing, you need to determine the following:

- Identify which **Fishing District** you will be fishing (Eastern, Central, or Western).  
- Read the **Standard Regulations** that apply to all waters in that district.  
- Look up the specific water you will be fishing to see if it is listed as an **Exception** to the Standard Regulations.  
- If that is identified in the Exceptions, these regulations take the place of the **Standard Regulations** (e.g., season, daily limits, etc.). 
- If not listed in the Exceptions, the **District Standard Regulations** apply.
