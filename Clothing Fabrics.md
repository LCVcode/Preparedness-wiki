## Overview
Different fabrics have wildly different properties, making some suitable in certain survival situations where others are not.  

## Fabric Types
### Cotton
Cotton is a very common clothing fabric that has the following qualities:
- Comfortable
- Breathable
- Absorbs moisture
- Slow to dry
- Loses insulation when wet
### Wool
Wool is a very old-school survival fabric, and it is tried and tested.  It has some very desirable properties, but also a few downsides that prevent it from being universally useful.  Here are some qualities of wools:
- Excellent insulation
- Retains warmth, even when wet (not as well as synthetics)
- Naturally water-resistant
- Resistant to becoming smelly or crusty
- Fire-resistant
- Can be heavy
- Slow-drying
- Often more expensive
- Difficulty of care
Nowadays, people don't typically use common sheep's wool.  Something like Merino Wool is much more desirable.  
### Synthetics (Nylon & Polyester)
- Durable
- Lightweight & packable
- Quick-drying
- Insulates well when wet (better than wool)
- Excellent moisture-wicking
- Generally quite affordable
- Not particularly breathable 
- Can get stinky
- Not fire resistant (melts to skin)
### Polyester-Cotton Blend
- Combines breathability of cotton with durability of polyester
### Wool-Synthetic Blends
- Combines warmth of wool with quick-drying properties of synthetics
## Fabric Thicknesses
### Lightweight
Ideal for hot weather and high-intensity activities.  Examples include thin cotton and lightweight nylon.
### Midweight
Versatile for a range of conditions and activities.  Examples include medium-thickness wools and polyester.
### Heavyweight
Best for cold weather and less intense activities.  Examples include thick wools and insulated synthetics.
